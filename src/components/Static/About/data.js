            What sets us apart is that our health content isn&apos;t just accurate and educational - it&apos;s also
            thoroughly entertaining. Since patients enjoy watching our content, they take the information onboard and
            digest it.

            This has a knock-on effect. Patients start to consider their health on a broader scale. They will ask more
            incisive questions, be more diligent with their medication, and investigate the treatments and procedures
            offered by their practice.
