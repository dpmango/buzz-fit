            It is Buzz Fit’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
            website. This privacy policy applies to https://buzz.fit (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, or “https://buzz.fit”).
            We are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the website.
            We have adopted this privacy policy to explain what information may be collected, how we use this

            Like most website operators, Buzz Fit collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Buzz Fit’s purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how Buzz Fit’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
            Buzz Fit may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
            on trends, on the usage of its website. Buzz Fit also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the
            Buzz Fit website. Buzz Fit only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. Gathering of
            personally-identifying information, certain visitors to Buzz Fit’s website choose to interact with Buzz Fit,
            in ways that require Buzz Fit to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
            information that Buzz Fit gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
            download the app to provide the physical address where the app will be playing.
