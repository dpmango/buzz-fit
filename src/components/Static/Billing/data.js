            Generally, we will charge your payment method for your item when we ship it to you or confirm its
            availability. Please note, we may pre-authorize your order amount with your credit card, credit account, or
            debit card issuer at the time you place the order. This may have an effect on your available credit line.
            When you pre-order with a debit card, we will debit your card when you place the pre-order. For digital
            items, we’ll charge your payment method when you initiate the download of the product or the product is
            placed in your account and available for use.
