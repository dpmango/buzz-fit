                    <p>It is Buzz Fit’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
                        operating our website. This privacy policy applies to https://buzz.fit (hereinafter, “us”, “we”,

                    <p>Like most website operators, Buzz Fit collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                        that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Buzz Fit’s purpose in
                        collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Buzz Fit’s
                        visitors use its website. From time to time, Buzz Fit may release non-personally-identifying
                        information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends, on the usage of its
                        website. Buzz Fit also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
                        Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Buzz Fit
                        website. Buzz Fit only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
                        Gathering of personally-identifying information, certain visitors to Buzz Fit’s website choose
                        to interact with Buzz Fit, in ways that require Buzz Fit to gather personally-identifying
                        information. The amount and type of information that Buzz Fit gathers depend on the nature of
                        the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who download the app to provide the physical
                        address where the app will be playing.</p>
